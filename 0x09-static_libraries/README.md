C - Static libraries
0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
Create the static library libmy.a containing all the listed  functions
1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future  
Create script called create_static_lib.sh which creates a static library called liball.a from the .c files located in the current directory.
